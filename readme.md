# Bitcoin Sniffer

Generates random bitcoin addresses, and compares against a list of addresses.

Based off [Michal2SAB's Bitcoin stealer](https://github.com/Michal2SAB/Bitcoin-Stealer)

Curently it can generate around 1 million addresses a minute. Though there is 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976 possible combonations. So it is **Highly** unlikely that you will find a valid address.

# Address list

The address list that I am using is to big to put in to github, so you will have to get your own. You can find it at [this bittalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5254914.0), or [addresses.loyce.club](http://addresses.loyce.club/?C=M;O=D). If those dont work, just search up `Funded Bitcoin Address list` or something like that.
